# Feauters to be implemented

## Functionality
* sum up all hp, also for different "inriktningar"
* give courses "en/flera inriktining/ar" possible as an array
* Start with indek, data, strateg√≠ and show all O-courses.
* Let users add more courses with search field
* Search bar for master and technical "inriktning"
* Bring in grades and averages


## Styling
* Replace checkbox with more declarative message box, saying "not started"(red), "in progress"(yellow) or "finished"(green) and style the row with the same color, just lighter
* Make trashcans be clickable in a better way (atm it is a href that doesn't link to anything to make it look clickable)
* Get single for courses
* Style navbar and put it in a more central location such as general header
